What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
- I was struggling with the Inception-like idea of multiple branches both a local and a cloud repository, and definitely afraid of merge conflicts.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
- Push versus pull from online repo, the proper order of operations for the git workflow, and how many characters there can be in a commit message (50!) Plus! A totally low-stress occurrence of merge conflicts was really helpful, too.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
- I asked both my pair and my guide for help with navigation, as well as asked for clarity on how to push to GitHub.

What still confuses you about Git?
- The push-to-GitHub-and-reconcile-changes process is still a little wobbly, but I feel more confident with it now that we've reviewed it in GPS. 

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
- I had a very positive experience â€” both my guide and my pair were friendly, patient, and kind, and I think we developed a warm, supportive rapport.
