## What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
Prior to the GPS, I was struggling with knowing:

- when to branch - how granular changes/features should be
- how to fix a merge conflict
- pulling and merging as a team


## What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
I definitely have a more clear understanding of the concepts listed above.  Just having the opportunity to talk through the concepts with others helped solidify my understanding greatly.


## What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
- Background / current work
- Git workflow best practices
- Origin vs. Master


## What still confuses you about Git?
How granular a feature/branch should be is still a gray area for me.  I'm sure this understanding will come in time.


## How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
My first GPS pairing was great!  Concepts seem to solidify much more easily when you can collaborate and ask questions in real time.  I look forward to the future GPS and 1:1 pair programming sessions.
